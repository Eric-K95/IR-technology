The IR sensor is an electronic instrument that detects IR signals in specific frequency ranges and converts the signal to electric signals on its output pin. In this exercise, practice how to use the TCRT5000 tracking sensor and the obstacle avoidance sensor. The TCRT5000 tracking sensor has the function of emitting infrared radiation and receiving the reflected radiation to the photodiode. This sensor is possible to set the reflective range from 1mm to 25mm. Next, the IR obstacle avoidance sensor detects an object in range around 2-40cm. This sensor also emits frequency of infrared and receives the reflected signal back from the object.
